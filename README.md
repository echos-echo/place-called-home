# place-called-home
This project is a website about a place I've lived/visited. Integrates design, organization of information, content, navigation (site mapping), using both HTML5, CSS, and other languages if necessary. (project is incomplete at the moment).
The location my site is based on is New York City, NY, USA.

Currently hosted at https://people.rit.edu/~eec5213/ISTE240/project1/index.html

The site, including the splash screen/homepage, included 10 pages of content including:
- history
- dining
- activities
- attractions
- central park
- galleries
- maps
- travel tips
- seasonal tips
- about me
- criteria (for the project)
- resources (works cited)

All nonoriginal work is cited; otherwise, all content is original and made by me.

Dark mode is enabled, and to some extent is mobile friendly (better on desktop browsers though)
