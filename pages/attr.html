            <h1 class="header">Oh, The Places You'll Go!</h1>
            <p>New York City has so many historical places, as well as significant landmarks. Ranging from largely populated hubs to serene little nooks, I hope that someplace in this list may suit your fancy and enhance your trip to NYC.</p>
            <div class="attr">
                <h3>Grand Central Station</h3>

                <p>You've likely heard of Grand Central Station, and oh boy is it an architectural marvel. The entire project was funded by Vanderbilt over a century ago. While the station does function as... a station, it's also a center of commerce as it houses many retail stores within the building. Retail and shopping aside, it's nice simply to walk through the building and admire the architecture of it.</p>
                <h3>New York Public Library, the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building</h3>

                <p>Perhaps it is odd to be recommended a library to visit when searching for tourist spots, but the New York Public Library system is a wonder. Located easily right by Bryant Park is the Stephen A. Schwarzman building of the NYPL system, one out of four libraries in the city. This building is the flagship for the system, and easily the most recognizable from only the ornate steps. Upon stepping inside, it's obvious that the entire building is made up of intricate details and meticulously cared for by the staff. Even if you aren't particularly into books or reading, do consider taking some time to visit this place.</p>

                <h3>DUMBO</h3>
                <figure>

                <p>Surely you're wondering what DUMBO actually means. The letters stand for "Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass", and this area is made up of both the area directly under the Manhattan Bridge up until where the Brooklyn Bridge meets Brooklyn.</p>
                <p>This place is a beautiful walkway along the Brooklyn Waterfront, offering a view of both major bridges simultaneously. Furthermore, the area is filled with food places so excellen that walking into any hole in the wall location is guaranteed to have you with a treat or meal you'll be satisfied with. The area has also had a huge hipster movement, and many coffee roasteries/cafes have opened up.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest key features of DUMBO is of course, Jane's Carousel which appears right by the water encased in glass (picture below). </p>
