            <h3>Eve Cho, New York resident and RIT Student</h3>
            <p>My name is Eve Cho, and I am currently a 3rd year Computer Science student at RIT. I've been a resident of New York State for 16 years and counting, and live just an hour outside NYC via metropolitan transit.</p>
            <p>This website is a cumulation of my personal knowledge of the city, as well as additional research and places I still plan on visiting (but am currently unable to do so due to the nature of the pandemic). I myself have learned through trial and error the ways to efficiently navigate the city, first as a 'tourist' and later as someone more familiar with the environment.</p>
            <p>Apart from figuring out how to find my way around the city, my friends and I are also massive foodies, and are always looking for new places to eat in the city, sometimes even stumbling into a pleasantly surprisingly hole-in-the-wall restaurant. From sweets to savories, moody restaurants or chic cafes, and ranging from $ to $$$$, we're determined to try all the various ethnic foods the city takes pride in.</p>
            <p>I hope that this guide offers you some guidance on your trip to NYC, whether it helped out a lot or only provided a few places to take note of.</p>
