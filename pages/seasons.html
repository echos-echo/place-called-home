            <h1 class="header">The Seasonal Guide to NYC</h1>
            <p>Being a massive tourist city, foot traffic in NYC fluctuates greatly throughout the year. Not to mention, the weather loves to range from unbearably hot and humid to bone chilling freezing. There are definitely seasons and holidays where the city becomes far more packed, but there are also times of the year where the city hosts seasonally exclusive activities. Do check these out and consider them when planning your trip!</p>
            <h6>Note: please be seasonally aware of the weather in NYC during your planned stay and pack weather appropriate clothes. Summers easily reach sweaty highs of 100 degrees fahrenheit, while winter can drop to -20 degrees fahrenheit and dangerously ice pathways over.</h6>

                <p>Perhaps the least known of seasonal pastimes in the big city, Roosevelt Island is a small island on the Hudson River lying between Manhattan and Queens. During as early as late March, the cherries that line Roosevelt Island bloom into a frenzy of petals, showering the island in a soft pink arrival of Spring.</p>
                <h3>Wollman Rink in Central Park</h3>

                <p>Part of Central Park, Wollman Rink is one of several rinks featured in the city, and always become bustling with skaters as the wintertime season rolls around.</p>

                <p>Arguably the busiest and most crowded rink of all the ones in the city, Rockefeller Center is a trademark image of New York City, as well as the large Christmas tree that millions of tourists stop by to see year after year.</p>
